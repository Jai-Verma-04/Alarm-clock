# ALARM CLOCK

Steps to run this properly:
1. Download any music file to be set as the alarm tone.
2. save that file on your local desktop (But remember its full path)
3. copy the file's path and paste it in the line 49 of the code [inside the load method used by pygame]
4. Run the program..

# HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
1. Enter the amount of time you want the alarm to be set (For Ex.- If you want to set the alarm for 10 mins, input 10 as the 'amount of time')
2. Then the user is prompted to enter the Unit of time (Considering the previous example, mins was the unit)
The user would just need to enter the following for the unit of time
s: seconds
m: minutes
h: hours
3. The alarm would be set, and two different strings of datetime will be displayed as follows:
   The time at which the alarm is set.
   The time at which the alarm will end.
4. The alarm will ring on time.
5. Thanks for using.
