# Encode-Decode
 Simple text encoder and decoder!
Steps to run this properly:
1. Download any music file to be set as the alarm tone.
2. save that file on your local desktop (But remember its full path)
3. copy the files path and paste it in the line 49 of the code [inside the load method used by pygame]
4. Run the program..


# What the program does
Takes input string from a user. Encode or decode the string (as selected by the user).
For encoding and decoding the string the user needs to provide a value at the time of doing the operation.
This value is called 'decode value' while decoding the string and 'encode value' while encoding the string..
If you encypted a string with a specific encode value, remember that value to decode the string to its initial string..

(Additionaly: Share the encoded string a encode value with your friend and they can decipher the message using this program)
